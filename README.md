# Recipe App
The Recipe App uses the following technologies and javascript libraries:
* MongoDB
* Express.js
* Node.js
* Express-handlebars
* Mongoose
* Body-parser

## What is this?
The recipe app will keep track of various recipes that you like to cook and eat. Users will be able to add their own recipes, including ingredients and directions. They will also be able to categorize recipes and rate them.

The app will also function as a shopping list. Users will have the ability to add ingredients from their recipes to a shopping list.

## What did I learn and Why is it Important
This project is going to be a great project due to the number of user interactions and data points that will be stored. It will require an interesting data model and multiple API endpoints. The app should be useful as well, it will allow users to keep track of a personal recipe collection and use it for planning and shopping.
